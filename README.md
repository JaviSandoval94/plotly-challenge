# Introduction
Whether we like it or not, microbes are always around us and even in our own bodies. This project uses interactive visualizations created with Javascript and Plotly to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity data set from The Public Science Lab of NC State. These visualizations allow the user to filter results based in different individuals to find  the populations and varieties of the operational taxonomical units (OTU's) found in the study. The application shows ethnicity, gender, age, location and washing frequency for each of the individuals along the OTU results. The final deployed application can be found [here](https://javisandoval94.github.io/plotly-challenge/index.html).

# Data set
The data for this project comes from the Belly Button Biodiversity data set from The Public Science Lab of NC State. The data set is available [here](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).

# Code explanation
The script takes the DOM elements from the `index.html` template in this repository. The script is written in the `app.js` file, so make sure to have all the files available in the `static` folder to run the application and display the results in the HTML template.
